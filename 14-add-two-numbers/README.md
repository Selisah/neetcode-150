# 14 · Add Two Numbers (Medium) · Linked List

## The problem
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each node contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list, also in reverse order.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

## Examples
- `l1 = [2, 4, 3]`, `l2 = [5, 6, 4]` returns `[7, 0, 8]` (342 + 465 = 807)
- `l1 = [0]`, `l2 = [0]` returns `[0]`
- `l1 = [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]`, `l2 = [9, 9, 9, 9]` returns `[8, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 1]`

## Constraints
- The number of nodes in each list is in the range `[1, 100]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 9`
- Each list has no leading zeros, except the number 0 itself.
